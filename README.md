<h3 align="center">ViLoW is a system that displays videos shared by the user on a platform for access on mobile devices or desktop on home network.</h3>

<p align="center">These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.</p>
 

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installing

- After installing the tools mentioned above you are ready to run the application and / or contribute to the project.

- Now you can clone this [ViloW Server](https://github.com/leopedroso45/ViLoW), [ViLoW Client](https://github.com/leopedroso45/ViLoW_Client) and open it in your favorite editor, I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)!  :)

### You need to modify some paths for everything to work properly

- By default, the volume folder where videos should be stored is **C:\data**, but you can easily modify this in the Docker-compose file.

- Now you can run: 
```docker-compose run --build```

## Built With
